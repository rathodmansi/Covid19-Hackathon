# Covid19-Hackathon

The Covid-19 pandemic has clutched the entire world for as long as 7 months. This has caused unprecedented damages socially and economically all over the world. 
With the entire force of world leaders and health workers working towards it, there still exist a lot of untested domains. In our efforts to combat this fight, we have selected one particular area and worked to generate insights.

# Problem Statement

We aim to understand how weather changes (more specifically air temperature) influence the rate of infection (R0). We know other coronaviruses like SARS have better stability at lower temperatures (source), but higher temperatures can increase social contact.
For our hypothesis testing, we have considered only Seattle city-level data to remove any noise due to state level weather conditions. Also, we have restricted the time frame to the lockdown period to negate the impact of government interventions.
